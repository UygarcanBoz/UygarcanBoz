Welcome to my page!
My name is Can, computer engineering graduate from Turkey.

Graduated in 2021. During my studies, I have acquired technical IT knowledge and skills as well as practical and business skills during my Erasmus+ internship in Lithuania. I'm eager to learn new languages, technologies and develop my skills.
